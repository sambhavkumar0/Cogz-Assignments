a. Project: College Library System

b. Five User Stories:
	1. As a student, I want to search for books by title or author, so that I can quickly find the book I need.
	2. As a librarian, I want to add new books to the system, so that they are available for student access.
	3. As a student, I want to check the availability of a book, so that I know if I can borrow it.
	4. As a librarian, I want to track overdue books, so that I can send reminders to students.
	5. As a student, I want to reserve a book online, so that I can collect it later without waiting.

c. Acceptance Criteria:
- Story 1: Search for books
  - The search should allow partial matches for title or author.
  - Results must show book title, author, and availability.
  - The search should return results within 2 seconds.

- Story 5: Reserve a book online
  - A student can only reserve if the book is available.
  - Once reserved, the book is held for 2 days.
  - Reserved books cannot be borrowed by others during this period.


2. Agile Estimation (15 mins)

a. Story Point Estimates (Fibonacci series):
1. Search for books – 3 points
2. Add new books – 2 points
3. Check availability – 2 points
4. Track overdue books – 5 points
5. Reserve a book online – 5 points

b. Reasoning:
- Searching and checking availability are simpler functions – lower points.
- Adding books requires form validation.
- Tracking overdue books and reservations involve more complex logic and notification handling.

c. Refinement Suggestions:
- "Track overdue books" can be split into:
  - Detecting overdue
  - Sending reminders
- "Reserve a book online" could be split into:
  - Reservation logic
  - Notification system


3. Agile Metrics and Reporting (15 mins)

a. Burndown Chart:
A Burndown Chart shows the remaining work versus time. It tracks the progress of a sprint and helps identify delays or roadblocks.

b. Mock Burndown Chart (5-day sprint, total 17 points):

| Day        | Planned Remaining Points | Actual Remaining Points |
|------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Day 1      | 17                        | 17                       |
| Day 2      | 13                        | 15                       |
| Day 3      | 9                         | 11                       |
| Day 4      | 5                         | 6                        |
| Day 5      | 0                         | 0                        |

c. Other Useful Agile Metrics:
	1. Velocity – Average story points completed per sprint.
	2. Lead Time – Time taken from task start to finish.
