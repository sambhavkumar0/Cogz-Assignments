a. List the 4 core values of the Agile Manifesto:

	Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.

	Working software over comprehensive documentation.

	Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.

	Responding to change over following a plan.

b. Describe any 3 out of the 12 Agile principles in your own words:

	Customer satisfaction by early delivery: Deliver valuable software early and often to keep the customer happy.

	Welcome changes in requirements: Even late in development, changes are welcome to give the customer a competitive edge.

	Simplicity: Focus on the essentials and eliminate unnecessary work.

c. Reflect on a situation where traditional project management might fail and explain how Agile could help:

	In traditional project management, a detailed plan is created at the start, and any changes later in the process are difficult and costly. For example, in developing a mobile app, changing user preferences or market conditions can make original requirements obsolete. Agile helps by allowing iterative development, continuous feedback, and quick pivots to meet evolving needs.
